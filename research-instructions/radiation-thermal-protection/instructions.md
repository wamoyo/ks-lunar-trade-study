# Radiation and Thermal Protection - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Systems and materials for protecting crew and equipment from radiation exposure and extreme thermal conditions on the lunar surface.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational protection systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Radiation shielding materials
- Thermal insulation systems
- Multi-layer insulation (MLI)
- Radiators and heat rejection systems
- Active thermal control systems
- Passive thermal protection
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely theoretical shielding concepts
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial radiation protection without space adaptation

## Key Terminology Variations
- Radiation shielding
- Thermal protection system (TPS)
- Multi-layer insulation (MLI)
- Thermal control system
- Heat rejection system
- Passive thermal control
- Active thermal management

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- NASA Glenn Research Center (materials research)
- Aerospace material suppliers
- Space suit manufacturers (thermal systems)
- Satellite thermal control vendors

### Key Search Terms
- "space radiation shielding"
- "lunar thermal protection"
- "MLI for space"
- "radiation protection materials"
- "space thermal control"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA thermal/radiation tech
- Space material suppliers catalogs
- ISS thermal control system vendors
- Academic research translating to commercial products

## Expected Challenges
- Materials often custom-designed per application
- Performance specs depend on mission profile
- Radiation protection effectiveness varies by particle type
- Thermal specs depend on lunar location and time of day

## Success Criteria
