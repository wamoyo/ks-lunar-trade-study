## Specification Completeness

### Required Fields (100% coverage)
- [ ] All items have vendor name
- [ ] All items have model/variant designation
- [ ] All items have TRL rating with source
- [ ] All items have source URLs for each specification
- [ ] All items have notes field (even if empty)

### Performance Specifications (100% coverage for applicable items)
- [ ] All communications systems have data rates documented
- [ ] All RF systems have frequency bands documented
- [ ] All relay satellites have orbit information documented
- [ ] All systems have operating environment documented (temperature, radiation)

### Physical Specifications (75%+ coverage target)
- [ ] At least 75% of items have mass (kg)
- [ ] Items without mass have note explaining why (e.g., "Not publicly disclosed")
- [ ] At least 75% of items have power requirements
- [ ] Items without power have note explaining why

### Commercial Specifications (50%+ coverage target)
- [ ] At least 50% of items have cost estimates
- [ ] Items without cost have note explaining why (e.g., "Service pricing, not equipment sale")
- [ ] At least 50% of items have turnaround time
- [ ] Items without turnaround have note explaining why

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Every specification has source URL
- [ ] All sources are credible (vendor official, NASA, technical papers, trade press)
- [ ] No Wikipedia as sole source (OK as supplementary)
- [ ] Screenshots captured for key specifications (stored in output/communications-systems-sources/)
- [ ] At least 50% of systems have multiple source verification

## Minimum System Count

- [ ] **Lunar relay satellites:** At least 5 systems documented (Target: 5-8)
- [ ] **Surface networks:** At least 2 systems documented (Target: 2-4)
- [ ] **Transponders/radios:** At least 8 systems documented (Target: 8-12)
- [ ] **Optical communications:** At least 3 systems documented (Target: 3-5)
- [ ] **Ground network equipment:** At least 5 systems documented (Target: 5-8)
- [ ] **DTN implementations:** At least 2 systems documented (Target: 2-4)
- [ ] **Total systems:** At least 25 distinct systems documented (Target: 25-40)

## TRL Verification

- [ ] All items confirmed TRL 5 or higher
- [ ] TRL sources are authoritative:
  - [ ] NASA TechPort project data, OR
  - [ ] Vendor official statement, OR
  - [ ] Credible technical paper/report
- [ ] Any systems below TRL 5 removed from JSON or moved to notes

## Cross-Verification and Conflict Resolution

- [ ] At least 50% of systems have multiple sources
- [ ] Any conflicting specifications noted and investigated
- [ ] Best available data selected with rationale in notes

## Phase 1 Vendor Completion

All vendors identified in Phase 1 have complete profiles:

- [ ] All Phase 3 iterations documented in `phase3-research/iteration-NN.md`
- [ ] `output/communications-systems.json` exists with all items
- [ ] `output/communications-systems-sources/` folder created with screenshots
- [ ] This completion checklist maintained and updated after each iteration

## Ready for Phase 4

Research is ready for Phase 4 verification when:
- [ ] All coverage criteria checkboxes above are checked
- [ ] All specification completeness targets met (100% for required, 75% for physical, 50% for commercial)
- [ ] Minimum system count targets met (25+ total systems)
- [ ] All TRL 5+ systems documented
- [ ] JSON file complete with all found systems (verified: false initially)

## Final Check Before Phase 4

- [ ] Review completion checklist - all items checked
- [ ] Review JSON file - all items have complete structure (even if some fields null)
- [ ] Review iteration notes - all strategies executed and documented
- [ ] Ready to begin systematic verification of all data points
