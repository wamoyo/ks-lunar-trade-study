# Communications Systems - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Communication equipment for lunar surface operations, including Earth relay, surface-to-orbit links, and local area networks for crew and robotic systems.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational comm systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Earth-Moon communication systems
- Surface-to-orbit relay systems
- Local area networks (LAN) for surface operations
- Antennas and transponders
- Delay-tolerant networking (DTN)
- Radio systems
- Laser/optical communication systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely conceptual communication architectures
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial comm equipment without space qualification

## Key Terminology Variations
- Communication system / Comm system
- Lunar relay
- Deep space network (DSN)
- Lunar network
