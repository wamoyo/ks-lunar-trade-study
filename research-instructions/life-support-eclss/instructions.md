# Life Support and ECLSS - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) for lunar surface operations, including atmosphere management, water recovery, waste processing, and crew life support.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational ECLSS systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Atmosphere revitalization systems
- Oxygen generation systems
- CO2 removal systems
- Water recovery and purification
- Waste management systems
- Humidity control
- Temperature and pressure control
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Government-only Artemis-specific life support contracts
- Purely conceptual systems
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial life support without space qualification

## Key Terminology Variations
- ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System)
- Life support system
- Atmosphere revitalization
- Air revitalization
- Oxygen generation
- CO2 scrubbing
- Water recovery system
- Waste management

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Paragon Space Development Corporation
- Collins Aerospace
- Honeywell
- NASA JSC (technology transfer opportunities)
- Air Liquide (oxygen systems)

### Key Search Terms
- "ECLSS space"
- "lunar life support"
- "oxygen generation space"
- "water recovery system space"
- "CO2 removal space"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA ECLSS tech

## Expected Challenges
- Many systems are ISS-specific, need lunar adaptation
- Power consumption critical for lunar operations
- Mass and volume constraints significant
- Reliability and maintenance requirements vary

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) ECLSS systems identified
- [ ] Both open-loop and closed-loop systems documented
- [ ] TechPort searched for life support technology
- [ ] Power, mass, crew capacity specifications documented
- [ ] Consumables requirements noted
- [ ] Maintenance intervals and spares requirements clarified
