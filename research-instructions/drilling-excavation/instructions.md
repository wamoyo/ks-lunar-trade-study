# Drilling and Excavation - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Equipment for drilling, excavation, and regolith manipulation on the lunar surface, including resource extraction, construction support, and scientific sampling.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational drilling/excavation systems available NOW** (TRL 9, demonstrated)
- Drilling systems (core sampling, water/ice extraction)
- Excavators and scoops
- Regolith moving equipment
- Autonomous excavation systems
- Sample collection tools
- Trenching equipment
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely conceptual mining systems
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial drilling equipment without space qualification
- Hypothetical asteroid mining equipment

## Key Terminology Variations
- Drilling system / drill
- Excavator / excavation system
- Regolith processor
- Core sampler
- Trenching system
- Lunar mining equipment
- Scoop / bucket system
- Auger drill

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Honeybee Robotics (drills, excavation)
- Masten Space Systems
- Planetary Science Institute (sampling tools)
- Construction robotics companies adapting to space

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar drilling system"
- "space excavation"
- "regolith mining"
- "lunar core drill"
- "autonomous excavator space"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA drilling/excavation technology
- NASA SBIR awards for excavation systems

## Expected Challenges
- Lunar regolith very abrasive (wears components)
- Vacuum environment affects drilling mechanics
- Extreme temperature cycling
- Power requirements often significant
- Autonomous operation challenging

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) drilling/excavation systems identified
- [ ] Drilling and excavation systems documented separately
- [ ] TechPort searched for excavation technology
- [ ] Depth capability, speed, power requirements documented
- [ ] Mass, volume, mobility specifications noted
- [ ] Availability and customization options clarified
