# Power Systems - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Power generation and energy storage systems for lunar surface operations, including solar arrays, batteries, fuel cells, and nuclear power systems.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational power systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Solar array systems
- Battery energy storage
- Fuel cells
- Radioisotope power systems (if commercially available)
- Nuclear fission reactors (Kilopower, etc.)
- Power distribution systems
- Energy management systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Purely theoretical power concepts
- Terrestrial power systems without space qualification

## Key Terminology Variations
- Power system
- Solar array / photovoltaic system
- Battery system / energy storage
- Fuel cell
- Radioisotope power supply (RPS)
- Nuclear reactor
- Kilopower / fission power
- Power management and distribution (PMAD)

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- NASA Glenn Research Center (Kilopower)
- Lockheed Martin (power systems)
- Aerojet Rocketdyne (RPS, nuclear systems)
- Deployable Space Systems (solar arrays)
- ATK/Northrop Grumman (solar arrays)
- Eagle Picher (space batteries)

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar power system"
- "space solar array"
- "lunar nuclear power"
- "Kilopower"
- "space battery system"
- "lunar fuel cell"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA power technology
- NASA SBIR awards for power systems
- DOE nuclear power programs

## Expected Challenges
- Nuclear systems have regulatory constraints
- Lunar night (14 days) drives energy storage requirements
- Power output varies with temperature
- Many systems mission-specific

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) power systems identified
- [ ] Solar, battery, fuel cell, and nuclear options documented
- [ ] TechPort searched for power technology
- [ ] Power output, mass, efficiency specifications documented
- [ ] Operating temperature ranges noted
- [ ] Availability, regulatory requirements, and lead times clarified
