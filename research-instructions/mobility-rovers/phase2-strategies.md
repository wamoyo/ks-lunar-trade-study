# Phase 2: Search Strategies - Mobility / Rovers

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Lunar Surface Mobility Systems (Rovers)

## Analysis of Phase 1 Findings

### Current State
Phase 1 identified:
- **3 major LTV vendors** (Lunar Outpost/Lunar Dawn, Intuitive Machines, Venturi Astrolab) at TRL 5-7
- **1 operational small rover** (Lunar Outpost MAPP) likely TRL 8-9
- **1 international pressurized rover** (JAXA/Toyota Lunar Cruiser) at TRL 5-6
- **NASA TechPort projects** providing enabling technologies
- **Technology vendors** (GITAI robotic arms) for integration

### Gaps Identified
1. **Limited TRL 9 systems** - only MAPP rover appears operational
2. **Missing cost data** - contract values known but per-unit costs unavailable
3. **Power specifications** - rarely specified in kW
4. **Commercial availability unclear** - most systems under NASA contracts
5. **Mid-size rover class** - gap between 10kg and 1,500kg systems
6. **International vendors** - limited search beyond US/Japan
7. **Adjacent industries** - mining, construction, military rovers not explored

## Comprehensive Search Strategies

### Strategy 1: NASA TechPort Deep Dive

## Notes on Efficiency

**Parallel Execution:**
- Strategies 1-3 can be executed in parallel (different databases)
- Strategies 4, 7, 8 can be executed in parallel (different source types)
- Strategy 10 serves as validation throughout

**Iterative JSON Building:**
- Add items to `output/mobility-rovers.json` as found
- Don't wait for complete information
- Mark all fields `verified: false` initially
- Phase 4 will systematically verify

**Documentation:**
- Create `phase3-research/iteration-XX.md` for each search session
- Document what was searched, what was found, what remains
- Track progress against completion checklist
