# Mobility / Rovers - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Lunar surface mobility systems including pressurized rovers, unpressurized rovers, robotic vehicles, and crew transportation systems.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational rovers available NOW** (TRL 9, demonstrated)
- Pressurized rovers (crew vehicles)
- Unpressurized rovers (open cockpit)
- Robotic rovers (autonomous/teleoperated)
- Cargo transport vehicles
- Mobile platforms for equipment
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Government-only Artemis-specific rover contracts (unless commercially available)
- Purely conceptual designs
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial rovers without space qualification

## Key Terminology Variations
- Lunar rover
- Moon buggy / Moon rover
- Pressurized rover
- Unpressurized rover
- LTV (Lunar Terrain Vehicle)
- Surface mobility system
- Crew rover
- Robotic rover

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Lockheed Martin (LTV development)
- General Motors (Apollo LRV heritage, current development)
- Astrolab (FLEX rover)
- Lunar Outpost
- Venturi Astrolab
- Toyota (pressurized rover concepts with JAXA)

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar rover"
- "pressurized moon rover"
- "lunar terrain vehicle"
- "commercial moon buggy"
- "lunar mobility system"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA mobility technology
- NASA Artemis LTV program vendors
- JAXA lunar rover programs
- Robotic rover manufacturers

## Expected Challenges
- Few pressurized rovers operationally available
- Lunar dust mitigation critical
- Range and endurance specifications vary
- Power systems (battery vs solar vs hybrid)

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) rovers identified
- [ ] Pressurized, unpressurized, and robotic variants documented
- [ ] TechPort searched for mobility technology
- [ ] Range, speed, payload capacity specifications documented
- [ ] Power systems and operating duration noted
- [ ] Availability, customization options, and lead times clarified
