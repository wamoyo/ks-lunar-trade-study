## Data Completeness Observations

### Well-Documented:
- Mass specifications (most vendors provide, even government programs)
- Dimensions (generally available)
- Mission timelines (launch dates, deployment plans)
- Partnership structures (commercial + government collaborations clear)

### Poorly Documented:
- **TRL ratings:** Still only 2-3 systems explicitly state TRL
- **Power specifications:** Canadensys, UAE, UEL rovers lack power data
- **Cost:** Only Canadensys contract value known ($43M CAD), not per-unit cost
- **Commercial availability:** Many tied to government contracts, unclear if available to other customers
- **Turnaround time:** No vendors disclose manufacturing/delivery lead times

### Mining Systems Challenge:
- **HIPPO rover status unclear** due to Masten bankruptcy, assets sold to Astrobotic
- Mining systems may be project-specific rather than product offerings
- Need to clarify if HIPPO continues as Astrobotic product

- Space Capital, Seraphim portfolio review
- Recent funding announcements (2024-2025)

**Strategy 8: Academic Spin-offs**
- Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Stanford, Caltech, Georgia Tech
- International: ETH Zurich, TU Delft

- Power system vendors
- Autonomy software providers (beyond Lunar Outpost Stargate)
- Robotic manipulator vendors (beyond GITAI)

**Strategy 10: Industry Publications**

## Notes

- **International coverage strong:** Canada, UAE, South Korea now documented. China has operational TRL 9 systems but no commercial offerings.

- **Mining systems unclear:** Masten bankruptcy complicates HIPPO rover status. May now be Astrobotic asset.

- **Government vs. Commercial distinction critical:** Yutu/Yutu-2 are TRL 9 operational but not commercially available. Documented as reference only.

- **Small rover segment well-covered:** Multiple vendors in 3-35kg class (UAE, Korea, Canada, Japan, Europe, USA).

- **Power data gap persists:** Only GITAI and Astrobotic Polaris have disclosed power specifications.

- **Next priority:** Conference exhibitors, adjacent industries, and CLPS mission payload deep-dive to ensure no vendors missed.
