2. NASA TechPort thoroughly searched
3. All major international providers researched
4. At least 2 sources verify each critical specification
5. Completion checklist fully satisfied
6. JSON file contains all found systems with cited sources
7. Gaps are documented and explained

## Notes & Considerations

**Challenges Expected:**
- TLI payload capacity not always published (may need to calculate or infer)
- Pricing data commercially sensitive (expect many nulls)
- TRL ratings not standard for commercial vehicles (infer from operational history)
- International providers may have language barriers
- Export restrictions may limit commercial availability

**Quality Standards:**
- Prioritize official vendor sources over third-party
- NASA sources considered highly credible
- Industry publications credible for market data
- Wikipedia acceptable if well-cited, but verify claims
- Academic papers good for calculated performance data

**Data Integrity:**
- Every value must have source URL
- Mark verified: false initially
- Document assumptions and calculations
- Note when data is inferred vs. stated
- Track when specifications change (upgrades, variants)
