# Launch Vehicles - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Launch vehicles capable of delivering payloads to lunar orbit or lunar surface. Focus on commercially available or near-commercial systems (excluding government-only Artemis Program items).

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational systems available NOW** (TRL 9, currently flying)
- Launch vehicles with lunar mission capability
- Heavy-lift launch systems
- Both orbital delivery and direct lunar injection variants
- Reusable and expendable systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Government-only Artemis-specific systems (SLS, etc.)
- Pure LEO launchers without deep space capability
- Systems without clear lunar mission profile
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider

## Key Terminology Variations
- Launch vehicle
- Heavy-lift launch system
- Super heavy-lift launcher
- Launch system
- Rocket
- Space launch vehicle

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- SpaceX (Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, Starship)
- Blue Origin (New Glenn)
- United Launch Alliance (Vulcan)
- Rocket Lab (Neutron - in development)
- Relativity Space (Terran R - in development)

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar launch vehicle"
- "moon mission launcher"
- "deep space launch capability"
- "translunar injection"
- "cislunar launch"

### Specific Sources to Check
- NASA LSP (Launch Services Program) catalog
- Commercial space company websites
- SpaceNews launch vehicle coverage
- International space agencies (ESA, JAXA, CSA) commercial partnerships

## Expected Challenges
- Launch vehicles rarely list lunar-specific specs
- Most specs are for LEO; need to find translunar payload capacity
- Pricing is often negotiated per mission (not publicly listed)
- TRL ratings may not be published for commercial vehicles

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) commercial launch providers with lunar capability identified
- [ ] TechPort searched for NASA-funded launch tech
- [ ] International providers researched (not just US)
- [ ] TRL 5-8 systems documented with expected availability timeline
- [ ] Payload capacity to translunar injection documented (where available)
- [ ] Clear indication of availability/lead time for each system
