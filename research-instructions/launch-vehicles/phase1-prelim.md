# Phase 1: Preliminary Research - Launch Vehicles

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Launch Vehicles for Lunar Missions

## Executive Summary

The commercial launch vehicle market for lunar missions in 2025 is dominated by operational US providers (SpaceX, ULA) with emerging competition from Blue Origin and international providers (ESA, JAXA). The landscape shows clear maturity in reusable heavy-lift systems with proven lunar mission capability.

## Key Findings

### 1. Operational Systems (TRL 9)

**Primary Commercial Providers:**
- **SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5**: Currently operational, launching lunar missions (IM-2, Blue Ghost M1 in 2025)
- **SpaceX Falcon Heavy**: Operational since 2018, proven lunar capability with Dragon XL Gateway contract
- **ULA Vulcan Centaur**: Operational since 2024, demonstrated lunar mission with Peregrine lander
- **Blue Origin New Glenn**: First launch in 2025 (ESCAPADE mission), entering operational status

### 2. Translunar Injection Capabilities

Based on preliminary research:

- **Falcon Heavy**: ~16.8-23.4 tons to TLI (sources vary, needs verification)
- **Falcon 9**: Used for multiple 2025 lunar missions, specific TLI capacity needs verification
- **Vulcan Centaur VC2S**: 2,300 kg to TLI (confirmed)
- **New Glenn**: 7,000-20,000 kg to TLI (depending on variant)
- **H3-24 (JAXA)**: >6,000 kg to TLI
- **Ariane 6**: TLI capacity exists but specific numbers not found in preliminary search

### 3. Market State & Technology Maturity

**TRL Considerations:**
- Operational launch vehicles are effectively TRL 9 (proven in operational environment)
- However, TRL ratings are rarely published for commercial launch vehicles
- NASA TRL framework exists but commercial providers don't always use it publicly
- Will need to infer TRL from operational history and mission success

**Reusability & Turnaround:**
- Falcon 9: Record turnaround of 9 days between launches (booster B1088 in March 2025)
- Average Falcon booster turnaround: 40-45 days
- Falcon Heavy: Reusable with longer turnaround due to center core recovery complexity
- New Glenn: Designed for reusability, operational data emerging
- Vulcan: Partial reusability planned (engine recovery), currently expendable

### 4. Pricing Structure

**Published Pricing (where available):**
- Falcon 9 Block 5: $69.85M (2025 commercial)
- Falcon Heavy: $97M (reusable), $150M (expendable) - 2022 pricing
- Vulcan Centaur: ~$100M estimated
- ULA Delta IV Heavy: ~$450M (being phased out)

**Important Note:** Government contracts often significantly higher than commercial pricing due to additional requirements. Example: Falcon Heavy NASA contract at $117M.

### 5. International Providers

**Japan (JAXA):**
- H3 rocket: Operational in 2025, multiple variants (H3-22, H3-24, H3-30)
- H3-24: >6,000 kg to TLI
- Used for LUPEX mission (joint with India)

**Europe (ESA/ArianeGroup):**
- Ariane 6: Operational in 2024
- Two variants: Ariane 62 (2 boosters), Ariane 64 (4 boosters)
- Lunar capability exists, specific TLI numbers need verification
- User manual exists with detailed performance data

**India (ISRO):**
- Participating in lunar missions but using JAXA H3 for LUPEX
- Chandrayaan-3 demonstrates lunar capability
- Launch vehicle details need further research

**China (CNSA):**
- Long March family with demonstrated lunar capability
- Government-focused, commercial availability unclear
- Needs verification for commercial access

- Launch vehicle mass and dimensions
- Operational history and mission lists

**Difficult to Find:**
- Specific TLI payload capacity (rarely published, mission-specific)
- Exact pricing (commercially sensitive, contract-dependent)
- TRL ratings for commercial vehicles (NASA uses it, companies don't always publish)
- Power requirements (not applicable to launch vehicles)
- Detailed turnaround time specifications (operational data emerging)

### 9. Current Industry Trends

**Reusability:**
- SpaceX leading with proven Falcon 9/Heavy reusability
- Blue Origin New Glenn designed for reusability from start
- ULA Vulcan planning engine recovery (not yet operational)
- Cost reduction primary driver

**Launch Cadence:**
- SpaceX: Record 2023/2024 launch rates demonstrating commercial maturity
