### 5. NASA TechPort Deep Search

**Search Approach:**
- Targeted web searches: site:techport.nasa.gov + keywords
- Keywords used: "heavy lift", "launch vehicle", "lunar", TRL

**Projects Found:**

1. **Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) System** (Project 106585)
   - Lunar landing navigation technology
   - Not a launch vehicle, but lander technology

2. **Reusable, Aeroassisted Orbit Transfer Vehicle (Hercules)** (Project 95508)
   - TRL 5-6 technologies
   - Concept vehicle for lunar/Mars operations
   - Not commercially available

3. **High-Fidelity Prediction of Launch Vehicle Liftoff Acoustic Fields** (Project 10436)
   - Acoustic modeling for heavy lift launch vehicles
   - Analysis tool, not a vehicle

4. **Lunar CATALYST** (Project 32426)
   - Lunar lander development program
   - Not launch vehicles

**Results Analysis:**
- TechPort searches primarily returned **lunar lander** and **surface technology** projects
- Few commercial **launch vehicle** projects found (makes sense - launch vehicles developed commercially, not through NASA R&D)
- Most relevant TechPort content is for **payload** technology, not **launch systems**
- Commercial launch providers (SpaceX, ULA, Blue Origin) develop vehicles independently

**TechPort Conclusion:**
- TechPort is valuable for payload/lander technology
- Launch vehicles themselves are primarily commercial developments
- NASA evaluates completed vehicles through LSP rather than funding their development
- TechPort search requirement satisfied but limited launch vehicle content found
