# Phase 2: Search Strategies - Storage and Logistics

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Storage and Logistics
**Focus:** TRL 5+ systems only

## Strategy Overview

Based on Phase 1 findings, the storage and logistics landscape divides into three major subsystems:

## Metrics Priority

For each storage system, collect in priority order:

1. **TRL** (required) - determines inclusion criteria
2. **Capacity** - volume (m³) and/or mass capacity (kg)
3. **System mass** - dry mass of storage system itself (kg)
4. **Power** - if active system (kW)
5. **Boil-off rate** - for cryogenic systems (% per day or kg/day)
6. **Pressure rating** - max operating pressure (bar or psi)
7. **Temperature range** - operating limits
8. **Cost** - estimated acquisition cost (expect many gaps)
9. **Turnaround time** - especially for cargo services
10. **Thermal control type** - passive MLI, active cooling, hybrid
11. **Material** - aluminum, composite, steel, etc.
12. **Flight heritage** - missions flown

## Expected Challenges and Mitigation

### Challenge: Cost Data Scarcity
- **Mitigation:** Focus on cargo service pricing ($/kg delivered), which is more available than tank hardware costs
- **Mitigation:** Use contract award values where available (may be total program, not unit cost)
- **Mitigation:** Document cost as "unavailable" rather than guessing

### Challenge: Boil-Off Rates Vary by Mission
- **Mitigation:** Document test conditions (LEO, GTO, lunar surface, etc.)
- **Mitigation:** Prefer lunar surface or long-duration data when available
- **Mitigation:** Note mission profile assumptions in the data

### Challenge: TRL Assessment Inconsistency
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize NASA TRL assessments from TechPort
- **Mitigation:** For non-NASA systems, use flight heritage as proxy (flown = TRL 9)
- **Mitigation:** Document TRL source and assessment basis

### Challenge: Commercial Availability vs Prototype
- **Mitigation:** Clearly distinguish operational (TRL 9), in production (TRL 7-8), and development (TRL 5-6)
- **Mitigation:** Note if system requires customization or is off-the-shelf
- **Mitigation:** Document lead time if available

### Challenge: International Data Access
- **Mitigation:** Use ESA/JAXA English-language press releases and fact sheets
- **Mitigation:** Reference Wikipedia for basic specs if primary source unavailable (but verify against other sources)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on companies with US partnerships (more accessible data)
