# Storage and Logistics - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Storage systems and logistics equipment for lunar surface operations including cryogenic tanks, cargo containers, material storage modules, and inventory management.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational storage systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Cryogenic propellant tanks
- Water storage systems
- Cargo containers and modules
- Material storage systems
- Pressurized storage
- Environmental control for storage
- Inventory tracking systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely conceptual storage architectures
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial storage without space qualification

## Key Terminology Variations
- Cryogenic tank / cryo storage
- Cargo module
- Storage container
- Material storage
- Propellant tank
- Water tank
- Logistics module
- Supply container

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Lockheed Martin (cryogenic systems)
- Boeing (cryogenic tanks)
- Sierra Space (cargo systems)
- Ball Aerospace (pressure vessels)
- Northrop Grumman (cargo modules)

### Key Search Terms
- "cryogenic storage space"
- "lunar propellant tank"
- "space cargo module"
- "water storage lunar"
- "pressurized storage space"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA storage technology
- ISS cargo module vendors
- Satellite propellant tank manufacturers
- Commercial space station cargo systems

## Expected Challenges
- Cryogenic storage requires active cooling
- Boil-off rates critical for long-term storage
- Mass and volume optimization important
- Lunar temperature extremes affect performance

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) storage systems identified
- [ ] Cryogenic, water, and cargo storage documented separately
- [ ] TechPort searched for storage technology
- [ ] Capacity, boil-off rates, mass specifications documented
- [ ] Thermal control requirements noted
- [ ] Availability and customization options clarified
