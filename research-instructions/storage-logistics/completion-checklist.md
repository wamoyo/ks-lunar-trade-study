- [ ] **Boil-off rate** - For all cryogenic systems (or marked as unavailable)
- [ ] **Commercial availability noted** - Off-the-shelf, customizable, or government-only
- [ ] **Lunar applicability assessed** - Heritage vs lunar-specific noted
- [ ] **Vendor verified** - Company name, website, contact info accurate

### Cross-Validation:

- [ ] **Vendor names cross-referenced** - Checked across multiple sources
- [ ] **Specifications verified** - At least 2 independent sources where possible
- [ ] **Conflicting data flagged** - Both sources documented with notes
- [ ] **Heritage vs new clearly marked** - ISS/satellite heritage vs lunar-designed

## Minimum Completion Criteria

Research is NOT complete until:

1. **At least 40 distinct systems documented** across all categories above
2. **All operational cargo systems (5-8 vehicles)** fully specified
3. **At least 10 cryogenic tank vendors** documented with specs
4. **At least 5 cryocooler vendors** documented (for ZBO systems)
5. **All Gateway storage systems (4-5 elements)** documented
6. **TechPort searched comprehensively** - At least 20 relevant projects reviewed
7. **SBIR/STTR database searched** - Phase II/III completions identified
8. **International vendors (5-10)** researched and documented
9. **Every item has TRL with source** - No TRL = not included
10. **Every item has at least 3 metrics with sources** - Gaps noted but sources required

---

## Research Complete When:

- [ ] All checkboxes above marked complete
- [ ] Minimum 40 systems in `output/storage-logistics.json`
- [ ] All systems have `verified: false` in Phase 3 (verification happens in Phase 4)
- [ ] All Phase 3 iteration notes document search process and findings
- [ ] No obvious vendor gaps (cross-checked against multiple source lists)
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 4 verification

---

**Status:** Phase 2 complete, proceeding to Phase 3 iterative research

**Next Action:** Begin Strategy 1 (NASA TechPort comprehensive search)
