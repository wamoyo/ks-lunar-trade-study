# Phase 1: Preliminary Research - Storage and Logistics

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Storage and Logistics
**Focus:** TRL 5+ systems for lunar surface operations

## Executive Summary

Storage and logistics for lunar surface operations encompasses three major subsystems:
1. **Cryogenic propellant storage** (LH2, LOX, LCH4) - critical for ISRU and propellant depots
2. **Cargo modules** (pressurized and unpressurized) - for equipment, supplies, and material transport
3. **Water and consumable storage** - life support and ISRU feedstock

The industry shows a clear divide between operational systems (TRL 9) proven on ISS and emerging lunar-specific technologies (TRL 5-7) addressing unique challenges like long-duration storage, zero boil-off, and extreme temperature cycling.

## Major Technology Areas

   - Technology areas: TX03 (Space Power), TX04 (Robotics/Autonomous Systems), TX06 (Human Health/Performance), TX07 (Human Exploration Destination Systems)

2. **SBIR/STTR database:**
   - Track companies with Phase II/III completions
   - Identify commercial products from NASA-funded R&D
   - Focus on CFM, storage, logistics topics

3. **ISS Commercial Cargo:**
   - Complete vendor list (CRS-1, CRS-2 contracts)
   - Specifications for all operational cargo vehicles
   - Lunar applicability assessment

4. **Gateway Program:**
   - All module contractors and subcontractors
   - Storage systems within each element
   - Technology spin-offs available commercially

5. **Satellite/Launch Vehicle Tank Vendors:**
   - Commercial satellite propellant tanks (GEO birds need long-duration storage)
   - Upper stage manufacturers
   - Pressure vessel certification companies

6. **Cryocooler/Thermal Vendors:**
   - Spaceflight cryocooler manufacturers

   - MLI blanket suppliers

7. **International Space Agencies:**
   - ESA commercial partners (Thales, etc.)
   - JAXA cargo partners (HTV specifications)
   - CSA contributions to Gateway storage

### Metrics to Prioritize

For storage systems:
- **Capacity:** Volume (m³) and/or mass (kg)
- **Boil-off rate:** % per day or kg/day
- **Mass:** Dry mass of storage system
- **Power:** Required for active systems (kW)
- **TRL:** Current readiness level
- **Cost:** Estimates available for cargo services ($/kg), tanks harder to find
- **Thermal range:** Operating temperature limits
- **Pressure rating:** For propellant/water tanks
- **Turnaround time:** Especially for cargo services

### Expected Gaps

- **Cost data:** Most vendors don't publish tank prices; cargo service pricing more available
- **Boil-off rates:** Varies by mission profile, often mission-specific
- **Lunar-specific testing:** Most systems tested for LEO/cislunar, not surface operations
- **ISRU integration:** Few systems designed with lunar resource utilization in mind
