- **MRE:** High power for melting regolith (>1,000°C) and electrolysis
- **Water Extraction:** Thermal energy for ice sublimation/melting
- **Solar Concentrators:** 10³-10⁴ suns concentration achieved with optical waveguides
- **Note:** Specific power requirements (kW) not consistently reported in preliminary sources

### Feedstock and Environmental Requirements

**Lunar Regolith Composition:**
- ~45% oxygen by mass (bound in silicate minerals)
- No beneficiation required (processes accept raw regolith)
- Dust mitigation critical for all mechanical systems

**Environmental Challenges:**
- **Vacuum:** All systems must operate in lunar vacuum
- **Temperature:** PSRs at <-200°C, illuminated areas -180°C to +120°C
- **Low Gravity:** 1/6 Earth gravity affects fluid dynamics, gas separation
- **Radiation:** Components must withstand lunar radiation environment
- **Thermal Cycling:** 14-day day/night cycle (except PSRs)

### Consumables and Reagents

**Key Design Philosophy:** Minimize consumables from Earth

- **MRE:** No consumables (uses only regolith + electricity)
- **Hydrogen Reduction:** Requires H2 (can be recycled, or from water electrolysis)
- **Carbothermal Reduction:** Requires carbon (can potentially use lunar CO or imported C)
- **Water Electrolysis:** Consumable-free (water → H2 + O2)
- **Cold Traps:** May require refrigerants or passive radiators
