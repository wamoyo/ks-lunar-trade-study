# ISRU and Resource Processing - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems for extracting, processing, and utilizing lunar resources including water ice, oxygen production, and propellant manufacturing.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational ISRU systems available NOW** (TRL 9, demonstrated)
- Water extraction systems
- Oxygen production from regolith (MOXIE-like)
- Propellant production systems
- Regolith processing equipment
- Electrolysis systems
- Chemical processing plants
- Resource beneficiation equipment
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely theoretical ISRU concepts
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Hypothetical fusion or advanced concepts

## Key Terminology Variations
- ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization)
- Oxygen production system
- Water extraction system
- Propellant production
- Regolith processing
- Resource extraction

## Expected Challenges
- Most ISRU systems are pre-commercial (TRL 5-6)
- Power requirements often very high
- Throughput rates and efficiency vary
- Feedstock quality affects performance

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) ISRU systems identified
- [ ] Water, oxygen, propellant production documented separately
- [ ] TechPort searched thoroughly for ISRU technology
- [ ] Production rates, power requirements, mass documented
- [ ] Feedstock requirements and consumables noted
- [ ] Availability and deployment timelines clarified
