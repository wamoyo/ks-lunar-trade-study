# Robotics and Robotic Arms - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Robotic systems, manipulator arms, and autonomous/teleoperated equipment for lunar surface operations including construction, maintenance, and sample handling.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational robotic systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Robotic manipulator arms
- Mobile manipulation platforms
- Autonomous robotic systems
- Teleoperated robots
- Construction robots
- Sample collection and handling systems
- End effectors and tools
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely conceptual robotic designs
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial robots without space qualification
- Research-only laboratory manipulators

## Key Terminology Variations
- Robotic arm / manipulator
