- [ ] JSON file created with at least Axiom AxEMU, SpaceX EVA (LEO), ISS EMU baseline
- [ ] Clear documentation of why so few options exist
- [ ] Commercial availability status confirmed for all systems
- [ ] All claims have source URLs

**Nice to Have (but can be incomplete):**
- Component supplier details
- International vendors (if none found meeting TRL 5+)
- Academic research projects
- Patent analysis details

## Review Checkpoints

Before marking research complete, verify:

1. **Coverage:** Have all search strategies been executed?
2. **Quality:** Do all data points have credible source URLs?
3. **Completeness:** Are gaps documented and explained?
4. **Accuracy:** Are TRL ratings verified from credible sources?
5. **Usability:** Is the JSON file well-structured and clear?
6. **Honesty:** Have I avoided speculation and clearly marked estimates?
