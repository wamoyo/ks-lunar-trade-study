# EVA Suits and Human Tooling - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Extravehicular activity (EVA) suits, portable life support systems, and tools for crew operations on the lunar surface.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational EVA suits available NOW** (TRL 9, flight-proven)
- Lunar surface EVA suits
- Portable Life Support Systems (PLSS)
- EVA gloves and boots
- Helmet systems
- Tools for surface operations
- Tethers and safety equipment
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Government-only Artemis-specific suit contracts (unless commercially available)
- Purely conceptual suit designs
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial pressure suits without space qualification

## Key Terminology Variations
- EVA suit / Spacesuit
- Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)
- xEMU (NASA designation)
- Pressure suit
- Surface suit
- Moonsuit
- PLSS (Portable Life Support System)

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Collins Aerospace (current EMU)
- Axiom Space (AxEMU for Artemis)
- SpaceX (EVA suit development)
- ILC Dover (suit softgoods)
- David Clark Company (pressure suits)
- Final Frontier Design

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar EVA suit"
- "commercial spacesuit"
- "xEMU"
- "surface spacesuit"
- "portable life support system"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA EVA technology
- NASA SBIR/STTR awards for suit tech
- Commercial diving industry (atmospheric suits)
- ISS EVA suit vendors

## Expected Challenges
- Most advanced suits are government-funded
- Pricing rarely public
- Suits are often custom-fitted
- PLSS specifications critical but may be proprietary

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) EVA suits identified
- [ ] Both suit and PLSS specifications documented
- [ ] TechPort searched for EVA technology
- [ ] Operating duration, pressure, mobility specs documented
- [ ] Mass, power requirements noted
- [ ] Availability, lead time, and customization options clarified
