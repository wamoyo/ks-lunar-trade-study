# Phase 3 Research - Iteration 02

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Strategies Executed:** Strategy 4 (International Vendors - ESA/JAXA), Strategy 5 (partial - Oceaneering tools), ILC Dover Astro update search

## Summary

Iteration 2 focused on international vendors (ESA, JAXA) and obtaining updates on ILC Dover Astro suit. Key findings: ESA/JAXA have no commercial lunar EVA suits meeting TRL 5+ criteria; ILC Dover Astro suit is actively being developed as part of Collins xEVAS contract, acquired by Ingersoll Rand in 2024. Oceaneering tools portfolio confirmed but detailed specifications require NASA technical documentation access.

## Search Activities Completed

### International Vendors - ESA (European Space Agency)

**Searches Performed:**
- ✅ ESA European spacesuit commercial EVA partners

**Key Findings:**

**ESA Eurosuit IVA Development:**
- **Type:** IVA (Intravehicular Activity) suit - NOT EVA
- **Partners:** Decathlon (lead), MEDES, Spartan Space, CNES
- **Timeline:** Prototype began late 2023; flight-ready by 2027-2028
- **ISS Test:** Planned for 2026
- **TRL:** Currently in development (estimated TRL 4-5 as of 2025)

**Key Insight:** The "Astro suit" announced in 2019 is now the Astro *architecture* used in the Collins xEVAS spacesuit. ILC Dover is the pressure garment supplier, not the prime contractor. The suit is being developed for ISS with lunar retrofit capability, but Collins withdrew from lunar development in June 2024 (per Iteration 1 findings).

**CONFLICTING INFORMATION:**
- Iteration 1 noted Collins withdrew from xEVAS in June 2024
- Iteration 2 found ILC Dover/Collins completed testing in Jan/Feb 2024 with 2026 demo planned
- **Resolution needed:** Check if Collins withdrawal was only from *lunar* portion or entire xEVAS

**Gap:** Need to clarify Collins xEVAS status post-June 2024 withdrawal announcement.

### Oceaneering EVA Tools

**Searches Performed:**
- ✅ Oceaneering EVA tools specifications catalog mass power ISS

**Key Findings:**

**Oceaneering EVA Tools Portfolio:**
- **History:** 5,000+ EVA items delivered, 400+ unique hardware solutions for Shuttle and ISS
- **Types:** Mini workstations, safety tethers, translation handholds, don/doff aids, debris vacuums, suit support systems
- **Source:** [Oceaneering Life Support & EVA Systems](https://www.oceaneering.com/spaceflight-solutions/life-support-and-eva-systems/)

**Example Tool - Trace Gas Analyzer (TGA):**
- **Type:** Self-contained, battery-powered mass spectrometer for EVA
- **Power:** EVA-qualified battery pack (common with existing EVA tools)
- **Mounting:** Hand-held, mini workstation, or body restraint tether
- **TRL:** TRL 9 (operational on ISS)
- **Source:** [SAE TGA Paper](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2001-01-2405/)

**NASA Reference Documentation:**
- "EVA tools and equipment reference book" (NASA NTRS 19940017339)
- Contains tools from shuttle-based EVA program
- **Gap:** Detailed specifications require direct PDF access from NASA NTRS
- **Source:** [NTRS EVA Tools Reference](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940017339)

**Conclusion:** Oceaneering is the dominant EVA tools provider with 40+ years NASA heritage. Specific tool specifications (mass, power, dimensions) exist in NASA technical documents but are not in easily accessible public catalogs. Tools are developed for NASA contracts, not commercially sold.

**Added to JSON:** Oceaneering EVA tools (general entry, noting specification access limitations)

## Collins xEVAS Clarification Search

Let me do a quick additional search to resolve the Collins contradiction:

**Search:** "Collins Aerospace" xEVAS June 2024 withdrawal ISS lunar

**Finding:** Per Iteration 1 sources (SpaceNews, NASA announcement June 2024):
- Collins and NASA mutually agreed to **descope** Collins' work
- Descope included ending ISS suit demonstration (targeted for 2026)
- Collins recognized development timeline would not support space station schedule
- Collins continues ISS **EMU sustainment** (existing suits)
- Collins withdrew from **next-generation** suit development

**Resolution:**
- Collins withdrew from developing **NEW** xEVAS suits for both ISS and lunar
- Collins continues maintaining **EXISTING** ISS EMU suits
- ILC Dover/Oceaneering were subcontractors to Collins; their role unclear post-withdrawal
- ILC Dover may continue suit development with other prime contractors or independently

**Updated Understanding:**
- The Jan/Feb 2024 testing was Collins' last major milestone before June 2024 withdrawal
- 2026 demo suit is no longer planned (Collins withdrew)
- ILC Dover Astro architecture may continue with different prime or as independent product
- Need to verify ILC Dover's current plans post-Collins withdrawal

---

## Next Iteration Plan

**Iteration 3 will focus on:**
- Strategy 6: Component suppliers (fabrics, bearings, batteries, helmets)
- Strategy 7: Academic research institutions
- Strategy 8: Patents and publications (partial)
- Clarify ILC Dover plans post-Collins xEVAS withdrawal
- Search for any remaining overlooked vendors

**Expected additions to JSON:**
- Component suppliers (if TRL 5+)
- Academic spinoff companies (if any)
- Refinements to existing entries based on new information

## Researcher Notes

International vendors (ESA, JAXA) are not commercially competitive in lunar EVA suits at TRL 5+. ESA focuses on IVA suits with Decathlon partnership; JAXA is in early research phase.

The ILC Dover Astro suit situation is more complex than initially understood - it's an architecture being used in Collins xEVAS, not a standalone commercial product. With Collins' June 2024 withdrawal and ILC Dover's June 2024 acquisition by Ingersoll Rand, the future of Astro suit commercial availability is uncertain.

Sierra Space partnership with ILC Dover suggests continued commercial LEO suit development, but specifics unclear.

Oceaneering dominates EVA tools market with no clear competitors identified. Tool specifications exist in NASA documentation but are not publicly cataloged in accessible format.

Next iteration should focus on component suppliers and verify if any academic research has transitioned to TRL 5+ products.
