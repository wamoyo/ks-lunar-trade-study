# Habitation and Inflatable Modules - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Lunar surface habitats, inflatable modules, and pressurized structures for crew living and working on the Moon. Focus on commercially available or near-commercial systems.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational habitat systems available NOW** (TRL 9, demonstrated)
- Rigid habitats and pressure vessels
- Inflatable/expandable modules
- Pre-fabricated lunar habitats
- Modular habitat systems
- Airlock systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Government-only Artemis-specific habitat contracts
- Purely conceptual designs
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial habitats without space rating

## Key Terminology Variations
- Lunar habitat
- Surface habitat
- Inflatable module
- Expandable module
- Pressurized structure
- Crew quarters
- Surface shelter

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Sierra Space (LIFE habitat)
- Bigelow Aerospace (historical - may be defunct)
- Lockheed Martin (lunar hab concepts)
- Blue Origin (habitat systems)
- AI SpaceFactory
- ICON (3D printed structures)

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar habitat"
- "inflatable space module"
- "expandable lunar shelter"
- "surface habitat system"
- "pressurized lunar structure"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA habitat tech
- ISS commercial module providers (potential lunar adaptation)
- Space station experience translating to lunar
- Defense contractors with habitat experience

## Expected Challenges
- Many systems designed for ISS, not lunar surface
- Mass and volume specifications critical
- Radiation shielding specs may be unclear
- Life support integration requirements vary

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) habitat systems identified
- [ ] Inflatable vs rigid options compared
- [ ] TechPort searched for habitat technology
- [ ] Volume, mass, crew capacity documented
- [ ] Radiation protection specifications noted
- [ ] Availability and customization options clarified
