# Phase 1: Preliminary Research - Habitation and Inflatable Modules

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Habitation and Inflatable Modules
**Researcher:** Claude Code

## Executive Summary

The lunar habitat market is experiencing significant commercial development with inflatable/expandable modules leading the charge. Multiple vendors have achieved TRL 5+ with some systems approaching TRL 9. The market is split between inflatable/expandable designs (offering volume efficiency) and rigid pressurized modules (offering durability). A third approach - 3D printed in-situ construction - is emerging at TRL 4-6.

**Key Finding:** The industry has matured significantly since Bigelow Aerospace's dormancy (2020). New entrants (Sierra Space, Max Space, Lockheed Martin) are advancing inflatable technology while international partnerships (ESA/Thales Alenia Space, JAXA) focus on rigid pressurized modules. NASA's commercial partnerships indicate readiness for lunar deployment by late 2020s.

**Market Size:** Projected to cross $2.24 billion by 2029, with 250+ lunar missions planned over the next decade.
