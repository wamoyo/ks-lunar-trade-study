# Landers and Cargo Delivery - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Lunar landers and cargo delivery systems capable of transporting payloads from lunar orbit to the lunar surface. Focus on commercially available or near-commercial systems.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational landers available NOW** (TRL 9, flight-proven)
- Lunar landers (crewed and uncrewed)
- Cargo delivery systems
- Precision landing systems
- Both expendable and reusable systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Government-only Artemis-specific systems (HLS exclusive contracts)
- Concepts without hardware demonstrated
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Orbital tugs without lunar landing capability

## Key Terminology Variations
- Lunar lander
- Moon lander
- Cargo lander
- Descent vehicle
- Landing system
- Surface delivery system

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Intuitive Machines (Nova-C)
- Astrobotic (Peregrine, Griffin)
- Blue Origin (Blue Moon)
- SpaceX (Starship - lunar variant)
- ispace (Hakuto-R)

### Key Search Terms
- "commercial lunar lander"
- "moon cargo delivery"
- "lunar descent system"
- "lunar payload delivery"
- "CLPS provider" (Commercial Lunar Payload Services)

### Specific Sources to Check
- NASA CLPS vendor list
- Commercial space company websites
- TechPort for NASA-funded lander development
- International programs (ESA, JAXA, CSA, UAE)

## Expected Challenges
- Many landers are mission-specific designs
- Payload capacity varies by landing site and mission profile
- Pricing often bundled with launch services
- Some systems may be tied to specific contracts

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) commercial landers identified
- [ ] NASA CLPS providers researched
- [ ] TechPort searched for lander technology
- [ ] International lander programs included
- [ ] Payload capacities and landing accuracy documented
- [ ] Availability and lead times clarified
