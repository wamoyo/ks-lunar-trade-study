**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Researcher:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Category:** Landers and Cargo Delivery Systems

## Executive Summary

The lunar lander and cargo delivery market is dominated by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which has 14 contracted vendors with a combined maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through November 2028. The landscape includes systems ranging from small-class landers (90-265 kg payload) to heavy cargo variants (12-15 metric tons). As of 2025, the field has transitioned from purely developmental to operational, with multiple successful landings achieved.

### Terminology Variations Discovered
- Lunar lander, Moon lander, Cargo lander
- Descent vehicle, Landing system
- Surface delivery system
- Human Landing System (HLS) vs Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)
- Human-class Delivery Landers (HDL) - NASA term for cargo variants

### Vendor Coverage Questions
- **Deep Space Systems:** No mission data found, CLPS status unclear
- **Orbit Beyond:** Withdrew from first CLPS task order, current status unknown
- **Moon Express:** No recent activity found
- **Ceres Robotics:** Minimal information available
