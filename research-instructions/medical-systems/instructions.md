# Medical Systems - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Medical equipment, diagnostic tools, surgical systems, and health monitoring equipment suitable for lunar surface operations.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational medical systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-qualified)
- Diagnostic equipment
- Surgical tools and systems
- Medical imaging equipment
- Health monitoring systems
- Telemedicine equipment
- Emergency medical supplies
- Dental equipment
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Terrestrial medical equipment without space qualification
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Equipment requiring extensive Earth-based infrastructure

## Key Terminology Variations
- Space medicine equipment
- Medical diagnostic system
- Health monitoring system
- Surgical system
- Telemedicine equipment
- Medical kit
- Crew health system

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- NASA JSC Biomedical Research
- ESA space medicine programs
- Wyle Laboratories (medical systems)
- Medical device manufacturers with space variants

### Key Search Terms
- "space medical equipment"
- "ISS medical systems"
- "remote surgery equipment"
- "space health monitoring"
- "telemedicine systems"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA medical technology
