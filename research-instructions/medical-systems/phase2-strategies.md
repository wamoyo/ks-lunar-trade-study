# Phase 2: Search Strategies - Medical Systems

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Medical Systems
**Status:** Strategy Development Complete

## Overview

Based on Phase 1 findings, medical systems research requires **multiple complementary strategies** because:
1. Limited commercial market means vendors scattered across industries
2. Terminology varies widely (space medicine, crew health, exploration medical)
3. Many systems are modified terrestrial equipment
4. Export controls limit public information
5. TRL data not consistently published
