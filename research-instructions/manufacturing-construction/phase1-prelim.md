# Phase 1: Preliminary Research - Manufacturing and Construction

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Manufacturing and Construction
**Researcher:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)

## Executive Summary

The lunar manufacturing and construction landscape is characterized by a small number of well-funded companies developing in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies, primarily focusing on 3D printing/additive manufacturing using lunar regolith. The technology is at a critical transition point, with systems advancing from TRL 3-4 (laboratory demonstrations) to TRL 5-6 (relevant environment testing) through NASA's MMPACT program and related initiatives. Key finding: **Very few systems have reached TRL 7+ operational readiness** - this is still an emerging field with most systems in development rather than commercially available.

## Major Findings

### 1. State of the Industry

**Current Status:**
- Industry is pre-commercial with heavy NASA/DoD funding driving development
- Primary focus on autonomous/robotic construction to minimize human exposure
- Three main technical approaches: laser sintering, molten extrusion, and microwave sintering
- Timeline: First lunar surface demonstrations targeted for 2026-2027, full-scale by 2031

**Key Challenge:** High energy requirements for regolith processing remain a major technical hurdle. Sintering requires significant power, making it dependent on breakthroughs in portable high-density energy or lunar surface energy acquisition technology.

3. **Regolith Properties:** Variable composition affects material properties and processing
4. **Quality Assurance:** How to verify structural integrity without terrestrial-style inspection?
5. **Dust Management:** Lunar dust is extremely abrasive and electrostatically charged
6. **Long-Duration Operation:** Mechanisms must survive thermal cycling, dust, vacuum for years

**Commercial Gaps:**
