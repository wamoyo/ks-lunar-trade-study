# Manufacturing and Construction - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Systems for in-situ manufacturing, construction, and fabrication on the lunar surface including 3D printing, assembly systems, and construction equipment.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational manufacturing systems available NOW** (TRL 9, demonstrated)
- 3D printing systems (additive manufacturing)
- Regolith-based construction systems
- Sintering equipment
- Fabrication tools
- Assembly systems
- Construction robots
- Structural assembly equipment
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely conceptual construction architectures
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial construction equipment without space adaptation

## Key Terminology Variations
- Additive manufacturing / 3D printing
- In-situ fabrication
- Lunar construction
- Regolith printing / sintering
- Contour crafting
- Construction automation
- Assembly system

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- ICON (3D printed structures)
- AI SpaceFactory
- Made In Space / Redwire
- Contour Crafting Corporation
- NASA Marshall (construction tech)

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar 3D printing"
- "regolith construction"
- "in-situ manufacturing space"
- "lunar fabrication"
- "additive manufacturing moon"

### Specific Sources to Check
