## Search Strategy 2: Astroport Space Technologies

### Searches Performed
- "Astroport Space Technologies lunar construction MMPACT"
- "Astroport Lunatron 3D printer specifications TRL lunar landing pad"

### Key Findings

**Company:** Astroport Space Technologies, Inc. (subsidiary of Exploration Architecture Corporation)
**Founded:** 2020
**Location:** San Antonio, Texas (Port San Antonio)

**Technology: Lunatron® 3D Construction Printer**

**TRL:** **Claims TRL 9 - Operational** ⚠️ (requires verification - seems optimistic)

**Technology Description:**
- Furnace-nozzle rolls across lunar surface scooping up moon dust
- Heats regolith to melt it into bricks
- Places bricks in continuous process (excavation + melting + placement)
- Can separate grains down to 70-micron level
- Uses 100% regolith without additional materials from Earth

**Primary Application:** Lunar landing pad construction

**Additional Technologies:**
- Lunar Regolith Melting technology
- Lunar Regolith Binding stabilization
- Materials separation and conveyance for bulk regolith manipulation

**NASA Partnership:**
- MMPACT program participant (studying molten regolith tiles)
- Two NASA Phase 1 STTR contracts awarded
- Partnership with UTSA (University of Texas San Antonio)
- ispace-U.S. collaboration for lunar regolith research instruments

**Timeline:** Projects system ready by 2030

- [Factories in Space Profile](https://www.factoriesinspace.com/astroport-space-technologies)

**TRL Verification Issue:**
The claim of TRL 9 appears in one source ([Factories in Space](https://www.factoriesinspace.com/astroport-space-technologies)) but conflicts with:
- 2030 readiness timeline (operational systems don't need 5 years)
- Phase 1 STTR status (early-stage NASA funding)
- MMPACT research participant status (development program)

**Revised TRL Estimate:** **Likely TRL 3-5** based on:
- Technology demonstrated in laboratory (TRL 3-4)
- Partnership testing with regolith simulants
- No evidence of space demonstration or full-scale prototype

**Assessment:** **INCLUDE IN JSON WITH CAVEATS** - Interesting technology, but TRL claim questionable. Document both claimed TRL 9 and estimated TRL 3-5 with notes.
