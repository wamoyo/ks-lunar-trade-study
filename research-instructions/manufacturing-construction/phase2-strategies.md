# Phase 2: Search Strategies - Manufacturing and Construction

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Category:** Manufacturing and Construction
**Based on:** Phase 1 Preliminary Research

## Strategy Overview

Manufacturing and construction for lunar applications is a nascent industry with limited commercial availability. Most systems are TRL 3-6 (development/testing phase) rather than TRL 7+ (operational). This requires multiple search strategies to capture:
1. NASA-funded development projects (primary source)
2. Commercial vendors transitioning from R&D to products
3. International space agency programs
4. Academic research approaching commercialization
5. Adjacent industry pivots (terrestrial construction 3D printing)

**Critical Insight:** Unlike mature markets, we won't find comprehensive vendor catalogs or published spec sheets. Most data is in NASA TechPort, SBIR awards, technical papers, and requires direct vendor contact.

## Search Strategy 1: NASA TechPort Comprehensive Search

**Objective:** Identify ALL NASA-funded projects at TRL 5+ related to manufacturing/construction

**Approach:**
1. Search terms (test each independently):
   - "lunar construction"
   - "lunar 3D printing"
   - "lunar additive manufacturing"
   - "regolith construction"
   - "regolith sintering"
   - "regolith printing"
   - "ISRU manufacturing"
   - "in-situ fabrication"
   - "lunar infrastructure"
   - "planetary construction"
   - "extraterrestrial construction"
   - "Moon construction"
   - "autonomous construction"

2. Technology Area filters:
   - TX07.2.3 (Surface Construction and Assembly) - PRIMARY
   - TX12 (Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing)
   - TX04 (Robotic Systems) - construction robots
   - TX10 (Autonomous Systems) - autonomous construction

3. Filters:
   - TRL: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (exclude < 5 as per methodology)
   - Destination: Moon_and_Cislunar
   - Status: Active, Completed (last 5 years)
   - Program: SBIR/STTR Phase II/III, Game Changing Development, NIAC Phase II/III

4. For each project found:
   - Extract: projectId, title, description, TRL start/current/end, lead organization, budget (if available)
   - Note: Project managers, technical contacts
   - Identify: Commercial transition potential
   - Track: Technology outcomes (transitioned to industry?)

5. Follow leads:
   - Cross-reference lead organizations (vendors) across multiple projects
   - Check if closed-out projects led to follow-on work
   - Identify vendor portfolios (same company multiple projects)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 relevant projects

## Search Strategy 2: Direct Vendor Research

5. For each award:
   - Company name → research current status
   - Original SBIR topic → check if completed
   - Follow-on funding → indicates success
   - Company website → check for commercial product

**Expected Results:** 15-25 companies (many may have pivoted or closed)

## Data Collection Framework

For each system/vendor identified, collect:

### Required Fields (TRL 5+ systems only):
- [ ] Vendor name and location
- [ ] System/model designation
- [ ] TRL with source/date
- [ ] Technology type (laser sintering, extrusion, etc.)
- [ ] Primary application (habitat, landing pad, etc.)
- [ ] Lead NASA program or funding source
- [ ] Commercial availability status

### Desired Fields (collect if available):
- [ ] Build volume (m³)
- [ ] Build speed (m³/hr or kg/hr)
- [ ] Power requirements (kW)
- [ ] Mass of equipment (kg)
- [ ] Regolith feedstock requirements
- [ ] Material properties produced (MPa, durability)
- [ ] Autonomy level (supervised/autonomous)
- [ ] Environmental operating range
- [ ] Cost (development or unit cost if available)
- [ ] Turnaround time / delivery timeline
- [ ] Project Manager / Technical Contact
- [ ] Source URLs (multiple for verification)

### Source Quality Assessment:
- Primary (vendor official site, NASA official docs) = highest confidence
- Secondary (technical papers, credible press) = medium confidence
- Tertiary (Wikipedia, general press) = lowest confidence, verify elsewhere

## Completion Checklist Cross-Reference

See `completion-checklist.md` for detailed criteria. Key metrics:
- Minimum 10 systems documented at TRL 5+
- All ICON/MMPACT technologies fully specified
- TechPort exhaustively searched (multiple keyword combinations)
- Top 5 vendors directly contacted
- International programs surveyed
- Academic transitions researched

## Timeline and Prioritization

**Week 1 (Priority 1):**
- Strategy 1: TechPort comprehensive search
- Strategy 2: Tier 1 vendor contact
- Strategy 3: SBIR/STTR database search

**Week 2 (Priority 2):**
- Strategy 2: Tier 2/3 vendor research
- Strategy 5: International programs
- Strategy 7: Government contracts

**Week 3 (Priority 3):**
- Strategy 4: Academic research review
- Strategy 6: Terrestrial company pivot potential
- Strategy 8: Conference proceedings

**Week 4 (Refinement):**
- Strategy 9: Standards bodies
- Strategy 10: Business intelligence
- Follow-up on all vendor contacts
- Gap analysis and targeted searches

## Quality Control Measures

1. **Cross-Reference Everything:**
   - If TechPort says TRL 6, verify with vendor or technical paper
   - If vendor claims capability, verify with independent source
   - Multiple URLs per data point preferred

2. **Track Search Coverage:**
   - Document which searches performed
   - Note if keyword returned zero results vs not searched
   - Prevent false negatives ("we didn't find it" vs "it doesn't exist")

3. **Version Control:**
   - Date all research iterations
   - Note when vendor information last verified
   - Flag stale data (>6 months old for active programs)

4. **Explicit Unknowns:**
   - Document what we tried to find but couldn't
   - Note vendor non-responses (attempted contact dates)
   - Identify data gaps for Phase 4 verification

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Vendors don't respond to requests
**Mitigation:** Multiple contact methods (email, web form, LinkedIn, phone), emphasize legitimate research purpose, offer to share anonymized findings

**Risk:** TRL ratings inconsistent across sources
**Mitigation:** Document all TRL claims with sources, note discrepancies, use most conservative (lowest) estimate

**Risk:** Specifications proprietary/ITAR restricted
**Mitigation:** Request what can be shared, focus on published papers/presentations, estimate based on similar systems

**Risk:** Technology obsolescence (research moves fast)
**Mitigation:** Focus on 2020-2025 information, note project end dates, verify if superseded by newer systems

**Risk:** International systems not accessible to US buyers
**Mitigation:** Document anyway for completeness, note availability restrictions, may inform future partnerships

## Notes on TRL 5+ Filter

Per master methodology, focus on TRL 5+. However, for manufacturing/construction context:
- **Include TRL 4** if: NASA Phase II SBIR with clear path to TRL 5+, or large-scale demonstration planned within 1 year
- **Exclude TRL 3** unless: Truly unique approach with no higher-TRL alternatives
- **Note TRL 2** systems only as "future watch" - not in main JSON output

Rationale: This category has fewer mature systems, so TRL 4 with clear advancement pathway is commercially relevant.
