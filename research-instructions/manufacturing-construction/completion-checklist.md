## Notes

This checklist is comprehensive to ensure no stone left unturned. Manufacturing and construction for lunar applications is emerging technology, so:
- It's OK to have many "unavailable" fields (document why)
- It's OK to have few TRL 7+ systems (that's the reality)
- It's NOT OK to skip search strategies without documenting results
- Quality over quantity: 10 well-documented systems > 30 half-researched

The goal is accurate representation of what's commercially available or nearly available, not inflating the market.
