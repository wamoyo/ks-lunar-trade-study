- [ ] Commercial availability status - documented for all
- [ ] Mission heritage - documented when available

### 9. Minimum System Count Requirements

Research is thorough when we have documented:
- [ ] At least 5 IMU systems (TRL 5+)
- [ ] At least 8 star tracker systems (TRL 5+)
- [ ] At least 4 TRN systems (TRL 5+)
- [ ] At least 3 LiDAR/laser navigation systems (TRL 5+)
- [ ] At least 3 beacon/surface navigation systems (TRL 5+)
- [ ] All orbital constellation programs documented (even if TRL < 5, for context)

**Total minimum:** 25+ distinct navigation/positioning systems in JSON

### 10. Cross-Reference Verification

- [ ] All vendors from Phase 1 preliminary research documented in JSON
- [ ] All systems cross-referenced against multiple sources
- [ ] No major vendor omissions (compared to industry knowledge)
- [ ] International vendors represented (not just U.S.)

### 11. Documentation Quality

- [ ] Each iteration documented in phase3-research/iteration-NN.md
- [ ] Search strategies executed documented
- [ ] Gaps and limitations identified
- [ ] Sources cited for all claims
- [ ] JSON file incrementally updated throughout Phase 3

### 12. Special Considerations for Navigation Systems

- [ ] Constellation programs documented (NASA LCRNS, ESA Moonlight, JAXA LNSS)
- [ ] LunaNet standards/framework documented (not a product, but important context)
- [ ] Complementary system relationships noted (e.g., TRN requires maps)
- [ ] Infrastructure requirements documented (beacons need deployment, constellations need satellites)

## Progress Tracking

**Current Status:** Phase 2 Complete - Moving to Phase 3

**Iterations Completed:** 0
**Systems Documented:** 0
**Vendors Researched:** 0

## When to Stop Research

Research is complete when:
1. ALL checkboxes above are checked
2. At least 25 systems documented in JSON
3. All major vendors investigated
4. Multiple search strategies confirm no major omissions
5. Diminishing returns - additional searches find no new TRL 5+ systems

## Notes

- This checklist will be updated as research progresses
- Additional criteria may be added if gaps are discovered
- Quality over quantity - thorough documentation of fewer systems is better than superficial coverage of many
- TRL 5+ filter is mandatory - do not document TRL < 5 systems
