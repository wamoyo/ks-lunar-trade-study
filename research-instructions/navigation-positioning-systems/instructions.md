# Navigation and Positioning Systems - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Navigation and positioning systems for lunar surface operations, including GPS-like services, inertial navigation, terrain-relative navigation, and location tracking.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational navigation systems available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Lunar navigation satellites/constellation systems
- Inertial measurement units (IMUs)
- Terrain-relative navigation systems
- Star trackers
- LiDAR and radar systems for navigation
- Beacon systems
- Position tracking systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely conceptual lunar GPS architectures
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial GPS without lunar adaptation

## Key Terminology Variations
- Lunar positioning system
- Lunar navigation
- LunaNet (NASA architecture)
- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- Terrain-relative navigation (TRN)
- Star tracker
- Beacon system
- Position tracking

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- Northrop Grumman (navigation systems)
- Honeywell (IMUs)
- Lockheed Martin (navigation)
- NASA Goddard (LunaNet development)
- Surrey Satellite Technology

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar navigation system"
- "lunar positioning"
- "LunaNet"
- "space IMU"
- "terrain-relative navigation"
- "lunar GPS"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA navigation technology

## Expected Challenges
- No existing GPS infrastructure on Moon
- Multiple competing lunar navigation architectures
- Terrain-relative navigation requires high-res maps
- IMUs require calibration

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) navigation systems identified
- [ ] Satellite-based and surface-based systems documented
- [ ] TechPort searched for navigation technology
- [ ] Accuracy, update rate, coverage specifications documented
- [ ] Power and mass requirements noted
- [ ] Availability and constellation requirements clarified
