# Environmental and Subsurface Sensing - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Sensors and instruments for environmental monitoring, geological exploration, resource prospecting, and subsurface investigation on the lunar surface.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational sensors available NOW** (TRL 9, space-proven)
- Environmental monitoring sensors (temperature, radiation, dust)
- Ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
- Seismic sensors
- Spectroscopy instruments
- Sample analysis equipment
- Water/ice detection systems
- Volatile detection sensors
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely research instruments without commercial availability
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Terrestrial sensing equipment without space qualification

## Key Terminology Variations
- Environmental sensor
- Subsurface sensing
- Ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
- Seismometer
- Spectrometer
- Volatile detection
- Resource prospecting instrument
- Geophysical sensor

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- NASA GSFC (instrument development)
- Malin Space Science Systems
- Ball Aerospace
- APL Johns Hopkins (instruments)
