# Phase 2: Search Strategies - Environmental and Subsurface Sensing

**Date**: 2025-12-08
**Category**: Environmental and Subsurface Sensing
**Objective**: Develop comprehensive search strategies to ensure complete coverage of TRL 5+ sensors

## Strategy Overview

Based on Phase 1 findings, we need multiple parallel search strategies because:
1. Vendors use varying terminology for similar sensors
2. Information is fragmented across government, commercial, and academic sources
3. Many sensors are mission-specific with limited public documentation
4. International vendors may not appear in US-centric searches
5. Commercial availability often depends on contacting vendors directly

Target: **TRL 5-9 sensors only** (exclude early-stage TRL 1-4)
