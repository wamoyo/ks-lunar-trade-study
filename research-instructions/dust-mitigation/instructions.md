# Dust Mitigation - Research Instructions

## Category Overview
Systems and technologies for mitigating lunar dust impacts on equipment, habitats, and operations including cleaning systems, coatings, and dust management.

## Read This First
**REQUIRED:** Read `/research-instructions/master-methodology.md` before starting research.

## Category-Specific Scope

### What to Include
- **PRIORITY: Operational dust mitigation systems available NOW** (TRL 9, tested)
- Dust removal systems (brushes, electrostatic, ultrasonic)
- Protective coatings and seals
- Dust-resistant materials
- Airlock dust management
- EVA suit cleaning systems
- Equipment protection systems
- **Include: TRL 5-8 systems** in development, testing, or approaching availability

### What to Exclude
- Purely theoretical dust solutions
- **Early development (TRL < 5)** - too early stage to consider
- Laboratory-only dust mitigation concepts

## Key Terminology Variations
- Dust mitigation
- Dust removal system
- Dust cleaning
- Electrostatic dust removal
- Dust protection
- Contamination control
- Dust shield

## Starting Points for Research

### Known Major Vendors (Not Exhaustive)
- NASA Kennedy Space Center (dust research)
- NASA Glenn Research Center (coatings)
- Dust mitigation technology developers
- Coating manufacturers

### Key Search Terms
- "lunar dust mitigation"
- "lunar dust removal"
- "electrostatic dust cleaning"
- "dust-resistant coating space"
- "regolith contamination control"

### Specific Sources to Check
- TechPort for NASA dust mitigation technology
- Apollo dust lessons learned documentation
- NASA SBIR awards for dust solutions
- Industrial dust control companies

## Expected Challenges
- Lunar dust extremely abrasive and clingy
- Electrostatic properties challenging
- Solutions often mission-specific
- Limited flight heritage for many technologies

## Success Criteria
Your research is complete when:
- [ ] All operational (TRL 9) and advanced (TRL 5-8) dust mitigation systems identified
- [ ] Active removal and passive protection documented separately
- [ ] TechPort searched for dust mitigation technology
- [ ] Effectiveness, power requirements, mass documented
- [ ] Application areas (suits, equipment, airlocks) specified
- [ ] Availability and integration requirements clarified
