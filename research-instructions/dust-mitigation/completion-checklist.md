---

## Final Checks Before Phase 4

- [ ] All 9 search strategies executed and documented
- [ ] All checkboxes in strategy sections marked complete
- [ ] Minimum 20 technologies in JSON
- [ ] All high-priority technologies documented
- [ ] Data quality targets met (see percentages above)
- [ ] No obvious vendors or technologies missing
- [ ] Iteration files provide clear audit trail of research
- [ ] JSON file properly formatted and validated
- [ ] Ready for systematic verification in Phase 4

---

## Research Complete When:

**ALL of the following are TRUE:**
1. Every checkbox above is marked complete
2. JSON contains ≥20 technologies from ≥15 vendors
3. All 9 search strategies documented in iteration files
4. High-priority technologies all included
5. Data quality targets achieved
6. No obvious gaps in coverage
7. Team consensus that market is comprehensively covered

**Estimated Completion:** 3-5 iterations over 1-2 weeks

---

## Notes

- If a checkbox cannot be completed, document why in iteration files
- "Not applicable" is acceptable if justified (e.g., no commercial vendors exist)
- Quality over quantity - accurate incomplete data better than inaccurate complete data
- Gaps in Phase 3 will be addressed in Phase 4 verification
- This is a living document - update if new search strategies emerge
