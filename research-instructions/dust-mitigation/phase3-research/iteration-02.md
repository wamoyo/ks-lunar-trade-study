## Data Gaps Identified

### Missing Information
- SPIcDER commercialization path (research vs product)
- Liquid N2 system cost, mass, power requirements
- Suitport commercial availability (NASA internal?)
- PlanetVac specifications (sample tool, not dust mitigation)
- Commercial vendors for modified vacuum cleaners

### Technologies Excluded
- DuSTI (testing program, not technology product)
- DMPT (TRL <5, low maturity)
- Traditional vacuum cleaners (Apollo-era, ineffective)

## Key Findings

### Technology Maturity Progress
- **TRL 9:** EDS (lunar surface demonstrated)
- **TRL 7-8:** ATSP bearings, AMSE coating, Suitport (testing phase)
- **TRL 5-6:** Bendable EDS, SPIcDER, xEMU devices, Liquid N2
- **TRL 4-5:** MOVE, Ultrasonic vibration, Lotus, WFM

### Spacesuit Protection Emerges as Major Category
- SPIcDER (carbon nanotubes)
- xEMU protection devices (Innovative Aerospace)
- Liquid nitrogen airlock cleaning
- Magnetic brush dust removal

### Airlock Systems Critical
- Liquid nitrogen spray (98%+ removal)
- Suitport (prevents dust entry)
- HEPA filtration (not deeply researched yet)
- Vacuum systems (limited effectiveness)

## Vendor Diversity

### Small Businesses (SBIR/STTR)
- PolyK Technologies (PKDML)
- ATSP Innovations (bearings)
- Applied Material Systems Engineering (coating)
- Innovative Aerospace (xEMU devices)
- Brand Griffin (suitport)
- Honeybee Robotics (PlanetVac)

### Universities
- Washington State University (liquid N2)
- Missouri S&T (ultrasonic)
- Texas Tech (MOVE)
- University of Colorado Boulder (Moon Duster)
- North Dakota (SPIcDER research lead)

### NASA Centers
- Kennedy Space Center (EDS all variants)
- Goddard (Lotus)
- Glenn (WFM)
- JPL (electron beam)
- Johnson (xEMU, suitport testing)

### International
- ESA (EDS testing, workshop lead)

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Research vs Product:** Many technologies are university research projects without clear commercialization path
2. **Spacesuit integration:** Hard to separate technology from NASA's xEMU program (proprietary)
3. **Cost data:** Absolutely no cost information available for most systems
4. **Mass data:** Only bendable EDS has published mass (500g)
5. **Overlapping technologies:** SPIcDER is CNT version of EDS concept
6. **Sample tools:** PlanetVac is sample collection, not dust mitigation (included for completeness)

## International Findings

### ESA Activity
- Active dust contamination research
- June 2025 workshop at ESTEC
- EDS efficiency testing in vacuum
