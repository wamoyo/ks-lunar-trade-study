I want to do a trades study of the currently available lunar surface equipment. Can you give me a list of commercially available or near-commercial equipment and systems to consider (excluding government-only Artemis Program items) for the following areas:

- Launch vehicles

- Landers and cargo delivery

- Habitation and inflatable modules

- Radiation and thermal protection

- Life support and ECLSS

- Medical systems

- EVA suits and human tooling

- Power systems

- Communications systems

- Navigation and positioning systems

- Mobility / Rovers

- Environmental and subsurface sensing

- Robotics and robotic arms

- Drilling and excavation

- ISRU and resource processing

- Manufacturing and construction

- Dust mitigation

- Storage and logistics (cryogenic tanks, cargo and material storage modules)

Agents are analysts that specialize in each area (one agent for each), much like an investment analyst develops deep knowledge and research capability for a particular market segment (or niche).

Each area should have a comparison table with the following metrics for each equipment and system option:

-Vendor

-Model/Variant

-TRL (NASA metric for readiess)

-Mass (kg)

-Power

-Est. Cost (USD)

-Turn around time (how quickly can we get one)

-Notes

My priority is accuracy of each metric and the ability to cite the sources of each. If the agent cannot find a specific metric from a credible primary or secondary source, please leave the metric blank. I want to see the gaps so that I can determine how to refine the process and what other sources may be required. The agent should provide a work cited by metric with links for traceability, which may be listed out below the comparison table. Screenshots are not required, but screenshots and links can be very useful for verification.

As an example, power and est cost are blank for the Falcon 9 because the number not be identified from a credible primary or secondary source. See below...

Launch Vehicles
Item 	Vendor 	Model/Variant 	TRL 	Mass (kg) 	Power (kW) 	Est Cost (USD) 	Notes
Space X Falcon 9 	Space X 	Block 5 	9 	549,000 			Lunar not directly stated; LEO figures available but not surface-specific.
