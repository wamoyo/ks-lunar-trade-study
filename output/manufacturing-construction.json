  "notes": "Lunar manufacturing and construction systems are predominantly TRL 3-6 (development/testing phase). Very few systems have reached TRL 7+ operational status. The market is pre-commercial with NASA MMPACT program (Project 116319) dominating the landscape. First lunar surface demonstrations targeted for 2026-2027. CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Power requirements NOW DOCUMENTED - range from 50W (mobile laser) to 10-12 kW (large-scale laser) to 400+ kW (industrial-scale continuous operations). Nuclear power likely required for large-scale construction; solar feasible for small-scale operations during lunar day. International programs (ESA RegoLight TRL 5, German MOONRISE TRL 5-6) advancing alongside U.S. efforts.",

Resulting density and bearing strength depend on: compaction energy, regolith grain size distribution, layer thickness, moisture content (water ice in shadowed craters).

Compacted regolith surfaces lower strength than additive manufacturing outputs but adequate for roads, foundations, landing pads with sufficient thickness."

Multiple machines required for full construction capability (backhoes, dump trucks, rollers) increases total system cost.

Milestones achieved: 2019 demonstration (habitation module), 2021 demonstration (remote operation 1,000 km), 2023 demonstration (water excavation with LIDAR/SLAM). Long timeline reflects: (1) mass reduction challenges for lunar transport, (2) power system optimization, (3) multi-machine fleet validation, (4) environmental qualification (vacuum, thermal, radiation, dust), (5) reliability for minimal maintenance. More conservative timeline than additive manufacturing systems due to complexity of fleet operations."

Kajima is one of Japan's largest construction companies, bringing decades of terrestrial expertise. A4CSEL terrestrially operational since 2010s with 'construction site as factory' concept. COMPLEMENTARY ROLE: Site preparation, excavation, grading essential before additive manufacturing. Also post-construction: roads, berms, trenches. JAXA TansaX programme involves 200+ organizations (90% non-space sector), leveraging Japan's manufacturing strengths. Different approach than U.S. focus on additive manufacturing - addresses full construction workflow. Demonstrates international diversity in lunar construction strategies."
